// Science teaching and science teacher quality is of international concern (Howe, 2006).

/* However, the teaching workforce in many countries is changing. For instance, science and
mathematics teachers have changing patterns of professional persistence, with some reports
indicating that 40% to 50% of new mathematics and science teachers leave the classroom in their
first three to five years (Cooper & Alvarado, 2006; Ingersoll, 2003; Ingersoll & Perda, 2012). In
the United States (US), this revolving door phenomenon has resulted in a teacher workforce that
is comprised of many first-year teachers (Ingersoll & Merrill, 2012; Ingersoll & Strong, 2011).*/

/*
Due to a combination of internal and external factors, the first years of teaching are
undeniably some of the most challenging in a teacher’s career (Luft, Dubois, Nixon & Campbell,
2014). In the US, novice science teachers are more likely than their more experienced peers to
teach in high-poverty schools with students from groups that are historically underrepresented in
the sciences. Many K-12 novice science teachers also have limited degrees or preparation in
science, engineering, or science education (Banilower et al., forthcoming).*/

Thus, one challenge facing science education is to improve teacher performance and
support in the early formative years. This translates into crafting teacher preparation, induction,
and professional development (PD) programs that maximize the learning of beginning teachers.
Science-specific support and PD programs have been shown to increase teachers’ practices in
science (e.g., Luft, 2001, 2009; Luft et al., 2011; McGinnins & Simmons, 1999). This is
particularly important in the US where reform-based science instruction expects that students
will develop an understanding of science through the incorporation of scientific knowledge,
scientific practices, and the nature of science (NOS) (NRC, 1996, 2012). As a result, teachers are
expected to enact effective science instruction, which includes inquiry and scientific practices,
NOS, and problem-based learning (PBL). These typically occur in a classroom environment that
is student-centered with the teacher as a facilitator.*/

However, there is little understanding of how beginning teachers learn to teach science in
reform-based ways. While it is known that this enactment is complex, there is a need to know
more about how science-specific induction and/or PD programs can support the type of
instruction envisioned in education reforms (Luft et al., 2014). This study investigates how a
state-wide, science-specific induction program for beginning secondary science teachers
impacted the confidence, understandings, and practices of the teachers’ NOS, PBL, and inquiry
instruction.*/

The context of this study was a state-wide induction program in a mid-Atlantic state that
supported beginning secondary science teachers through their beginning years in the classroom.
This was a randomized controlled trial investigation, with treatment participants receiving
instruction and support through the induction program, called the Secondary Teacher Program
(STP). This induction program focused on assisting the novices to develop their knowledge and
practices to teach science as inquiry, explicit NOS, and PBL in a collaborative environment that
promoted learning, feedback, reflection, coaching, and practice.
